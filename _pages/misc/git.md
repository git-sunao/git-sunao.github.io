## Introduction

Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes to their code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously and provides features for branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Git is widely used in software development and is hosted on platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

For people who will work in a large collaboration, it is strongly recommended to work with git.

### git config

Setting configuration in Git is important because it helps to personalize and optimize the behavior of Git for each user's specific needs. This includes setting the user's name and email for authoring commits, configuring the default text editor for commit messages, specifying aliases for frequently used commands, and more.

By setting configuration options, developers can streamline their workflow, reduce errors, and ensure that their commits are attributed correctly. It also helps to ensure consistency across different machines and environments, which is especially important when working collaboratively on a codebase.
