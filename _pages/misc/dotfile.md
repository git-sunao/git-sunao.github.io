Dotfile is a configuration file in Unix-based systems that is typically hidden because it has a dot (".") prefix in its filename.

These dotfiles contain settings and preferences for various programs and utilities, such as the shell, text editor, version control systems, and more. Examples of dotfiles include ".bashrc" for the Bash shell, ".vimrc" for the Vim text editor, and ".gitconfig" for the Git version control system.

Please see [my dotfile repository](https://github.com/git-sunao/dotfiles) as an example.
