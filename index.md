# Sunao Sugiyama

I am a PostDoctral Researcher at Kavli IPMU from Feb 1 2026, 
working on weak lensing.
I was previously a postdoc at UPenn working with [Bhuvnesh Jain](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/bhuvnesh-jain) from Seo 2023 to Jan 2026.
I got PhD from University of Tokyo, Japan, and worked at [Kavli IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) 
supervied by [Masahiro Takada](https://db.ipmu.jp/member/personal/698en.html). 
I completed the Bachelor's and Master's degree in University of Tokyo as well.

My main interest is in the cosmology using the observation of gravitational lensing. 
I also have additional interests in the numerical and statistical method enabling more efficient analysis of cosmology.

My CV is available in [English](https://github.com/git-sunao/cv/blob/main/en/sunao_type_base.pdf) and [Japanese](https://github.com/git-sunao/cv/blob/main/ja/sunao_type_base.pdf)
