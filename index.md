# Sunao Sugiyama

I am a PostDoctral Researcher at University of Pennsylvania from Sep 1 2023, working on weak lensing mainly with [Bhuvnesh Jain](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/bhuvnesh-jain).
I got PhD from University of Tokyo, Japan, and worked at [Kavli IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) 
supervied by [Masahiro Takada](https://db.ipmu.jp/member/personal/698en.html). 
I completed the Bachelor's and Master's degree in University of Tokyo as well.

My main interest is in the cosmology using the observation of gravitational lensing. 
I also have additional interests in the numerical and statistical method enabling more efficient analysis of cosmology.

My CV is available [here](https://github.com/git-sunao/cv/blob/main/cv.pdf).
