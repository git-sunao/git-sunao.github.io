# Sunao Sugiyama

I am a PhD student at [Kavli IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp/en) and University of Tokyo, Japan.
I am supervied by [Masahiro Takada](https://db.ipmu.jp/member/personal/698en.html). I completed the Bachelor's and Master's degree in University of Tokyo.

My main interest is in the cosmology using the observation of gravitational lensing. I also have additional interests in the numerical and statistical method enabling more efficient analysis of cosmology.

My cv is available [here](https://github.com/git-sunao/cv/blob/main/cv.pdf).
